# Industry Presentation Guideline
#### --AJ McCray
* * *

1. Disclaimer: This presentation is not meant to be a deep dive on these topics. Rather the purpose of this presentation is to reinforce foundational understanding of the development process.

1. **Waterfall** - *read slide* notice the phrase: each phase depends upon the deliverables of the previous phase. This conflicts with the iterative nature of application development. No working software is produced until near the end of the development life cycle

1. Scrum as an example: Product owner builds a backlog which is an prioritized list of tasks.
then a list of current to-dos is populated with a short list from the backlog. Team members then pull from the to-dos as they worked, pushing them through the development process.

1. RADIT (Requirements, Analysis, Design, Implement, Test) = sub-cycle within broader development cycle.

1. Workflow disclaimer: all of the workflow approaches listed here are methodologies and therefore are subject to changes by the implementing team. Rarely does a team 100% follow a single methodology

1. *After explaining slide:* Peer review is hugely important. Each member of a team should be able to review another team members code at any given point in the development life cycle.

1. The majority of DevOps revolves around the processes and tasks that do not directly contribute to the designing or building of an application, but instead encompass the housekeeping tasks that enable a team/individual to perform their work efficiently and effectively

1. As everyone probably remembers the MVC Framework separates the business logic and presentation layer.

1. **Discuss MVC flow**

1. Your application should be skinnable (if not you have erred).

1. MVC Features
    - Testability
    - Control of html and URL schemes
    - allows for sensible division of labor
    - improves search engine optimization options

1. To summarize: we have discussed some foundational development topics, contextualized them, and explained their purpose/importance
