# C# Homework 19

1. A collection that implements the System.Collections.IEnumerable interface.

2. A single GetEnumerator() method

3. a Current property with a getter, a MoveNext() method that returns a boolean, and a Reset() method that does not return a value.

4. MoveNext() returns true or false based on whether their is a list item at this location. It moves the pointer to the next item

5. Reset() returns nothing. Places the pointer at the first item in the list.

6. IEnumerator() has a generic type version which is type safe

7. because only static methods can be called recursively and therefore can't return a value

8. by implementing the IEnumerable interface

9. A block of code that yields an ordered sequence of values

10. returns a value during each iteration
